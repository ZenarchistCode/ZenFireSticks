[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod adds the ability to "place" sticks around an outdoor fire to cook with.

Once the sticks are placed they act like any other cooking item - the fire will slowly heat up the food until it's cooked (or burnt), and will damage the sticks over time.

It's created in such a way that the sticks are just placed by the fire and "linked" to the fireplace as an extra cooking slot - no attachments are added to the fireplace, and there's no persistence code so no wipe or anything like that is required to add/remove this mod.

There's no config - it uses all vanilla mechanics. This means it is a lightweight script mod and it should be compatible with any other mods which don't radically change vanilla fireplace cooking mechanics.

There is a limit of how close you can place the sticks to each other, making the max limit effectively 3 "placed" sticks you can cook with at a time, and the sticks damage relatively quickly to make sure cooking pots and tripods etc still remain a desirable item for survivalists.

The sticks can only be placed in diggable terrain - so fireplaces inside buildings, ovens, barrels or on concrete won't allow this feature.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be run on both client and server.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

Buy Me A Coffee:

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
